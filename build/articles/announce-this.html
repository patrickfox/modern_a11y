<p>#Announcing content with ARIA Live Regions</p>
<p>##How Live Regions Work</p>
<p>##Best Practices</p>
<p>###Use sparingly for pertinent messages
ARIA live regions provide a powerful means for announcing messages dynamically to users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve awareness and understanding
Pertinent UI changes and time-sensitive updates or messages should be brought to the user&#39;s attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>###Use a single Live Region</p>
<p>Live regions are very powerful means to announce content to users without moving their focus, but uncontrolled use can lead to added code complexity and maintenance issues.</p>
<p>Allowing developers, especially on larger teams, to use live regions ad hoc can causes unintended issues. Managing multiple live regions in a page can create headaches. </p>
<p>Only one live region can be heard at a time. As a best practice, use a single, common live region to speak all user messages. Any message that needs to be announced can simply be added to this common live region.</p>
<p>###How $.announce() works</p>
<p>-live region must be in the page at DOM load or very shortly thereafter
-with dynamic views(e.g. single page apps or dynamic UI), dynamically created live regions do not work in some screen reader/browser combinations(namely VoiceOver)
-reset live region before each message is announced
-clear live region content after brief pause</p>
<p>####Queuing Messages
At this time, there is not a way to queue messages other than to use <code>aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;</code></p>
