Sometimes a design calls for a complex component that is difficult to understand, operate...

Create a help system that uses a common keyboard shortcut(ctrl-H). When a component with help text available is focused, the element will state the "help text is available". When the user presses the shortcut, a script will detect which item is currently focused and announce its help text.
